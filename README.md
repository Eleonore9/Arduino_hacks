Arduino hacks
=============

Here's my [post] (http://blog.opensensors.io) on installing Arduino on Linux.

Arduino project using:
* Start Arduino Kit from Technology Will Save Us (with Arduino UNO)
* Linker Light Sensor N17DH from Maplin
* [ino tool] (http://inotool.org) to build and upload sketches using the CLI
* Arduino IDE 1.0.1 + upgraded wifishield firmware to solve issues with the wifi shield
