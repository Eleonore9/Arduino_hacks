Arduino hacks
=============

Here's my [post] (http://blog.opensensors.io) on installing Arduino on Linux.

Arduino project using:
* Start Arduino Kit from Technology Will Save Us (with Arduino UNO)
* Linker Light Sensor N17DH from Maplin
* [ino tool] (http://inotool.org) to build and upload sketches using the CLI
* Downgraded from Arduino IDE 1.0.5 to 1.0.2 to solve an issue with the wifi shield
